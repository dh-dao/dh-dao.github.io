The default Toolchain and Development-Tools from STM for STM32 are great. They have almost everything I need for developing embedded software on the STM32 microcontrollers. However, I really like the modern look of Visual Studio Code (VSC). If you are bored of the Eclipse-based IDE like STM32CubeIDE, you are like me. Even though VSC is a source-code-editor, it can be used as a powerful IDE with the right Plugins and settings. Another advantage of using independent *IDE* like VSC is the cross-plattform ability. You can use VSC on Windows, Linux or MAC. You can use VSC for development of different kind of Microcontrollers from different providers.
